#R doesn't like variable names that start with non-letters
#a lot of BRFSS variables start with an underscore, i.e., _
#sometimes you can wrap the variable name in quotes to resolve R's "I don't like variables that don't start with letters" issue
#e.g., llcp2017$"_STATE" will return the state column to you
#however, some tidyverse functions will make it seem like wrapping the variable name in quotes will resolve R's issues, but it doesn't
#e.g., llcp2017 %>% filter("X_STATE" == 6) returns you back an empty data frame

#a quick fix to cleaning variable names that start with non-letters is to export that data file out as a csv and then back in

library(rio)
llcp2017 <- import("LLCP2017.XPT")
export(llcp2017, "llcp2017.csv")
llcp2017 <- read.csv("llcp2017.csv", header = TRUE)

#I don't know how it works, but during the file conversion an X is put in front of all variable names that start with an _
#e.g., _STATE becomes X_STATE
#however, a bunch of data about the variables is lost when you convert your file to a csv

#to avoid data loss, you can manually put an X in front of each and every _variable
#e.g., llcp2017$X_STATE <- llcpa2017$"_STATE"
#this will add a new column called X_STATE to the end of the llcp2017 data frame which contains the contents of _STATE
#but do you really want to do this one by one for all the 80+ _variables? No you don't!

#in order to prevent data loss and avoid doing a bunch of extra work, import your XPT file, then run the following code 

library(tidyverse)
x_var17 <- select(llcp2017, starts_with("_"))
colnames(x_var17) <- paste("X", colnames(x_var17), sep = "")
llcp2017x <- cbind(llcp2017, x_var17)

#that's it!!
#you'll end up with duplicate columns, where each _variable will have a matching X_variable
#you can confirm that the rows didn't get mixed up between your _variables and X_variables by checking on _PSU and X_PSU
#_PSU is the primary sampling unit; it's basically the respondent id

#this is a quick check of the first ten rows
#make sure to set the variable class to integer because you can't really tell the numbers match in scientific notation
llcp2017x[1:10, "_PSU"]
as.integer(llcp2017x[1:10, "_PSU"])
as.integer(llcp2017x[1:10, "X_PSU"])

#this will tell you the _PSU and X_PSU that do match; it will be all of them
llcp2017x$"_PSU" == llcp2017x$X_PSU
which(llcp2017x$"_PSU" == llcp2017x$X_PSU)

#this will tell you the _PSU and X_PSU that don't match; it will be none of them
llcp2017x$"_PSU" != llcp2017x$X_PSU
which(llcp2017x$"_PSU" != llcp2017x$X_PSU)

#then you can subset your data file by selecting the variables that you want to keep
#e.g., llcp2017x %>% select(...)
